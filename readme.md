#### Your experience in Java

I have some experience in Java, and I used Spring Boot for a Angular + Spring Boot project for a year, 2 years ago.

#### What I did

- Added Log4j2 to replace default System.out.println
- The EmployeeService#getEmployee returns an Optional<Employee>, checked by the EmployeeController to return 404 if not present.
- I tried to add caching to the GetEmployee method, but I don't think I made it work.

#### What I would have done
- Fix a vulnerability issue in springfox-swagger-ui dependency.
